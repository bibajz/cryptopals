## Cryptopals solutions

DIY solutions written in OCaml.

### Goals

* learn more about cryptography
* get hands-on experience in OCaml

### Non-goals

* Previously, I wanted to get away with not knowing the auxiliary tools of OCaml ecosystem. That was a mistake - see the note below.

**EDIT (3rd September '22)** I was mistaken - Getting to know the auxiliary tools and libraries of OCaml is necessary for this project to fly the distance.
I was converted the test cases to [`Alcotest`](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest), I was yet unsuccessful with integrating the [`QCheck`](https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck) library.
Will look into that + better `dune` options soon.
