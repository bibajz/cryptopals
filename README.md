## Cryptopals solutions

DIY solutions written in OCaml.

### Goals

* learn more about cryptography
* get hands-on experience in OCaml

### Non-goals

* do not dive deeper than necessary into auxiliary Ocaml tools - as of today (23rd August '22) I use `dune` for project managment.
I made it work, but do not have time yet to figure out how. Similarly with `.ocamlformat`, the settings are "borrowed" (:D) from first project I saw using it.
